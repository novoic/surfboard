Core Surfboard classes: Waveform and Barrel
-------------------------------------------

At the heart of Surfboard lie two classes: the :code:`Waveform` class and the :code:`Barrel` class.

Feature extraction
------------------

An alternative to extracting features with the :code:`Waveform` class is to use functions specifically written for that purpose, either with the vanilla approach, or with the multiprocessing approach.

Under the hood
--------------

Under the hood lies a variety of files containing functions which are imported by the :code:`Waveform` class. We split the code as such for the sake of readability.
