Installing Surfboard
====================

Installing Surfboard is as easy as boogie boarding!

.. code::

    git clone https://github.com/novoic/surfboard
    cd surfboard
    pip install .

The package builds on LibROSA. You might need to install Libsndfile. On Linux:

.. code::

    sudo apt-get install libsndfile1-dev

On MacOS:

.. code::

    brew install libsndfile
